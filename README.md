## Description

A third-person shooter made with Unity. The game collects player's metrics (during gameplay) to affect on weapon damage modifiers based on their play style, strategy (activity of usage). The project uses **Barracuda** module to load a runtime model of ONNX format to operate input/output data (gather and predict values). It is a practical part of the **[bachelor's work](https://ela.kpi.ua/items/f57022f0-be84-4b3d-aa0e-f38f550e1ee1)**.
